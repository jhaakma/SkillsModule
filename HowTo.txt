--Instructions on Making and Using a Custom Skill:
Step 1: Create Skill icon

	A skill icon should be a dds file, 32x32 pixels in size, with a black icon over a transparent background
	The background image will be set automatically based on skill specialization. If no specialization is set, 
	the background will be grey in color. 
	
	Place your icon file in "/Icons/YourMod/iconName.dds", then refer to this path when registering your skill. 



Step 2: include/require skill module:

	Use 'include' if you want the skill module to be optional, otherwise use 'require'. ]
	At the top of each lua file that calls the skill module:
	
	local skillModule = include("OtherSkills.skillModule")
		or
	local skillModule = require("OtherSkills.skillModule")	
	
	If you use 'include', you need to check if the module exists before using it each time. 

E.g:

	if skillModule then
		skillModule.registerSkill("My_Skill") 
			--will only call the function if skillModule exists
	end
		
	local skillVal = skillModule and skillModule.getSkill("MySkill").value or 50
		--if skillModule not installed, default skillVal to 50

		
Step 3: Register the skill:

	Call registerSkill(id, skill) within the "OtherSkills:Ready" event.
	registerSkill() will add the skill the first time and ensure it is active from then on.
	Without registerSkill(), skills are deactivated on game-load, so if your mod is uninstalled, your 
	skill will automatically be deactivated as well.
	
	All fields are optional but you probably want a name, icon, starting value and description. 
	- If you want leveling your skill to also level up the player, set a governing attribute. 
	- If you want classes with a given specialization to gain 25% more experience for that skill, set a specialization
	- if you want to add the skill but have it inactive by default, set active to false

	Example:
		local function onSkillReady()
			skillModule.registerSkill("skill_id", 
			{	name 			=		"Skill Name", 							 	--default: skill id
				value			= 		5,											--default: 1
				progress		=		0, 											--default: 0
				lvlCap			=		200, 										--default: 100	
				icon 			=		"Icons/mod/skill_icon.dds", 				--default: a circle icon
				attribute 		=		tes3.attribute.strength,					--optional
				description 	= 		"Here is a description of the skill.",		--optional
				specialization 	= 		tes3.specialization.magic,					--optional. Icon background is gray if none set
				active			=		"active"									--defaults to "active"
				}
			)
		end			
		event.register("OtherSkills:Ready", onSkillReady)

			
Step 4: Use your skill:

	Use getSkill(id) to retrieve and use your skill, like so:

	local skillVal = skillModule.getSkill("MySkill").value
	local actionChance = math.random * skillVal --chance to perform action based on skill
	
	
Step 5: Increment skill

	When you perform an action with your custom skill, that skill should gain experience. Use incrementSkill() to do this:
	skillModule.incrementSkill( "MySkill_ID", {progress = 10} )
	
	Note that if your skill has a specialization, if the player's class matches that specialization, the skill will
	progress by 1.25x the value passed in this function. In the above example, if MySkill had Stealth as the specialization 
	and the player was an Assassin, performing the skill would progress it by 12.5 instead of 10. 
	
	
	
Notes:

	Activating/Deactivating your skill:
	If you want to control when your skill appears in the skills list, you can register it with the skill.active field set.
	Use a local variable that is set to either "active" or "inactive", and use that in the registerSkill(), so it sets it to the
	right value whenever you load the game
	
	When a skill is inactive, incrementSkill() will not do anything, and the skill won't appear in the Skills List.
